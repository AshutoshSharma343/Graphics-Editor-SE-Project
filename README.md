Graphics Editor Software
This project is a graphics editor software package designed to create line drawings involving various types of graphics entities. It supports a range of functionalities aimed at facilitating the creation and manipulation of graphic objects.

Introduction
For those unfamiliar with graphics editing software, it's recommended to explore the basic drawing features available in common tools such as MS-Word, PowerPoint, or other graphical drawing packages like AutoCAD. Understanding these standard features will provide a foundation for comprehending the functionalities offered by this graphics editor.

Features
The graphics editor supports the following key functionalities:

Creation of Geometric Objects: Users can create several types of geometric objects including circles, ellipses, rectangles, lines, polygons, and text entities.
Object Selection: Objects can be selected by clicking a mouse button on the object icon, which will be highlighted for visual identification.
Modification of Object Characteristics: Users can modify various characteristics of objects such as shape, size, location, color, fill style, line width, line style (dashed, dotted, continuous), and text content.
Manipulation of Objects: Selected objects can be copied, moved to a different location, or deleted as per user requirements.
File Operations: Users can save created graphics to disk under a specified name and load previously saved graphics files from the disk.
Importing Bitmap Pictures: Bitmap pictures can be imported into specified positions within the drawing.
Screen Management: Functionalities include defining a rectangular area on the screen and zooming to fill the entire screen, fitting the entire graphics to the screen, and panning to shift the displayed drawing along any direction.
Grouping: Users can create groups of objects, allowing complex drawings to be managed efficiently. Groups behave as single entities for move, copy, and delete operations.
Clipboard: A set of 10 clipboards are provided for copying various selected entities (including groups) for future pasting at different locations.
